## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser. No server setup required unless you want to serve files via HTTP.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gaur‑j/chess‑game.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd chess‑game
3. Open index.html in your browser.

## Usage

  - Click on a piece to select it.
  
  - Click on a square to move (if the move is valid).
  
  - Captures happen when a move is made to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece.
  
  - The game enforces turn‑taking between White and Black.

## How it works 

  - HTML — The structure of the chessboard and interface.
  
  - CSS — Styling for the board, pieces, highlighting moves, etc.
  
  - JavaScript — Game logic: tracking piece positions, move validation, capturing, turns.

## If applicable:

 - Event listeners capture user interactions (clicks/drags).
  
 - Internal data structure (e.g., 2D array or map) holds board state.
  
 - Functions check legality of moves (e.g. rook straight lines, bishop diagonals, knight jumps, etc.).
